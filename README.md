Cascade Meta-Learner

Cascade Meta-Learner architecture based on a Decision Tree Classifier.
A Cascade model allows achieving better performances in a prediction model, e.g., by escalating the number of depths of the model structure by each iteration in the process, which results in higher accuracy and better performance per instance as well as overall.
